"""
We're writing a program that adds two numbers together. 
Test this and solve any errors you find if you can. 
Solving one problem might turn up a new error...
Be sure to keep a note of whatever errors you find!
NOTE 1: T in "print" is missing
NOTE 2: there is "_" in number_2 when it should be "number2"
NOTE 3: line 12 didn't have a " at the end of the string.
